## Building Blocks of MagicBell

- <b>
    <a href="https://magicbell.com/docs/adding-magicbell-to-your-product">Embed</a>
  </b> our <b>notification inbox</b> in your app via our JavaScript snippet in under <b>
    ~30 minutes
  </b>
- <b>Fully customize</b> your inbox using our UI or with the <b>
    <a href="https://magicbell.com/docs/react/theme-customization">React SDK</a>
  </b>
- Select the <b><a href="https://magicbell.com/docs/channels">channels</a></b> you want to deliver notifications to: <b>In-app</b>, <b>email</b>, <b>web push</b> and <b>mobile push</b> <i>(SMS coming soon!)</i>
- Use our [API](http://localhost:3000/docs/rest-api/reference) to start sending notifications. `recipients` can be designated using an email address or `external_id`. You can also use our [API wrappers](http://localhost:3000/docs/libraries-api-wrappers) instead of making HTTP calls directly.
- <b>Announcements</b> allow you to easily send notifications to <i>all</i> users.{' '}
- Notification **content** supports HTML - make your notifications as pretty and robust as you want using inline CSS, images, inputs, etc
- Assign a <b><a href="https://magicbell.com/docs/categories">category</a></b> to each notification to enable users to manage their notification preferences. Categories also allow you to customize the delivery channels for a notification.
- `action_url` controls where a user goes when clicking on the notification. You can also define a `onNotificationClick` function to program this behavior.

Whether you are using MagicBell's inbox or building your UI, our SDKs take care of real-time updates and asynchronous state management for you.

The theme of your inbox can easily be changed using our application or directly in JavaScript. The React SDK allows full customization. The inbox below was built by <a href="https://pitch.com/">Pitch</a> - a series B startup.

### MagicBell Dashboard

At [app.magicbell.com/projects](https://app.magicbell.com/projects) you can change colors, typography, and additional styling. You must then copy the code in 'Notification Inbox Code' and paste the updated code into your application.

### React SDK

Our team built a ReactSDK to give you more power! An example is the ability to completely customize the in-app notification inbox to match the design of your product. See our [ReactSDK documentation](https://magicbell.com/docs/react/theme-customization) and the [React package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react) to learn more!

## Our Vision with MagicBell

Our goal is for customers to have a notification system as fast as possible - in under 30 mins - and continue to wow day after day. We vow to continue to make MagicBell a more powerful tool without compromising ease of use.

Building a notification system in-house is hard! There's a lot of complexity and a wide breadth of features needed: the in-app experience, multiple channels (email, SMS, push), managing notification preferences, branding, and more.

MagicBell takes care of all the work, so you never have to think about notifications again! 🙂
