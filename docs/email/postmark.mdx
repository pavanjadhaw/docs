## Sending Postmark emails from MagicBell's API

### Initial setup

- Sign up for Postmark and obtain a server API token
- Verify your sender signature in Postmark
- ✉️ Email your **server ID token** and **verified sender signature** (email address) in your account to hello@magicbell.com
- Verify the emails channel in MagicBell is enabled

### Sending the email

**No additional work is needed to send an email through Postmark**. Now that your account is set up, the default is send emails using Postmark. You can verify an email was sent in Postmark's application. MagicBell also automatically injects notification_id and broadcast_id as metadata into Postmark.

### Sending emails with additional or unique content

The `overrides` attribute allows you to send content unique to email, differing from other channels.

`Overrides` accept the exact attributes directly from [Postmark's documentation](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/email-api). Below is an example of a notification with an email subject line different from the title of other channels.

```shell hideHeader
"notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [{
        "email": "dan@magicbell.com"
    }],
    "overrides": {
        "providers": {
            "postmark": {
                "subject": "New subject header"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
