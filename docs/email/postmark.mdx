subtitle: How to use Postmark with MagicBell
---

## Deliver email notifications with your Postmark account

To configure Postmark for your MagicBell project, follow these steps:

- Sign up for Postmark and obtain a server API token
- Verify your sender signature in Postmark
- Send us your server ID token and verified sender signature (email address)
- Verify the email channel in MagicBell is enabled

Once your account is set up, MagicBell will automatically deliver email
notifications through your Postmark account, **no additional work is needed**.

Please keep in mind that MagicBell automatically injects both `notification_id`
and `broadcast_id` in the metadata of messages sent to Postmark.

## Sending emails with additional or unique content

Our [create notifications endpoint](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#create-notification)
allows you to customize the content sent to Postmark by setting
[`overrides`](https://magicbell.com/docs/overrides).

The `overrides` parameter accepts all of the body parameters of
[Postmark's Email API](https://postmarkapp.com/developer/api/email-api).

Below is an example of a tagged message with custom headers.

```json
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Welcome to MagicBell",
    "content": "The notification inbox for your product. Get started in minutes.",
    "category": "new_message",
    "action_url": "https://developer.magicbell.com",
    "recipients": [
      {
        "email": "dan@example.com"
      }
    ],
    "overrides": {
      "providers": {
        "postmark": {
          "Tag": "onboarding",
          "Headers": {
            "X-Original-To": "devs@example.com"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
