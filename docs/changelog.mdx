### Segmented send

You can now send notifications to all users or a segment of them. Set custom
attributes on your users to take full advantage of this feature.
[Learn more](https://magicbell.com/docs/segmented-send).

### Smart delivery

It’s good practice not to send notifications to all channels at once. Now - you don’t have to!

Smart delivery allows you to configure which channels the notification is sent to and when based on categories. You can also configure delays, and send only if the notification wasn’t seen on another channel. Please write to us and we can work with you to configure these smart notifications. A [demo of the feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4gPQjs1bnQ) can be found on our YouTube channel. 

### MagicBell notifications now on MagicBell!

You may have noticed a MagicBell notification icon on the sidebar now. Our team will be sending relevant notifications going forward. 

## September 6, 2021

### React headless v2

This new version introduces an immutable API, we stand on the shoulders of two
giants: Immer and Zustand. We made the repository public under a new license.
Read the
[full changelog](https://github.com/magicbell-io/react-headless/releases) for
further information.

### SendGrid and Mailgun templates

You can now send email notifications using your own SendGrid and Mailgun
templates. [Learn more](https://magicbell.com/docs/email/sendgrid).

```json hideHeader
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Your order with Example 923270",
    "overrides": {
      "providers": {
        "sendgrid": {
          "template_id": "[sengrid_template_id]"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Enhanced integration with delivery providers

MagicBell can now relay extra attributes to your providers when calling their
API. All you need to do is to send us a provider-specific override when using
the create notification API. This is helpful when you want to leverage extra
functionality offered by your providers.

```json hideHeader
{
  "notification": {
    "title": "Your order with Example 923270",
    "overrides": {
      "providers": {
        "ios": {
          "badge": 2
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Sidebar redesign

Our team is thrilled to introduce the [updated sidebar](https://app.magicbell.com/projects)!

### React SDK v8

We got rid of MobX, fixed an assortment of bugs, and changed to a proprietary
license.

## July 2021

### **Filter notifications by category**

We've added support for filtering notifications by category. You might find it
useful to add tabs to your notification inbox. Please check the [fetch notifications API](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#get-notifications)
endpoint documentation for details. Support is coming soon for the React SDK.

### **#2 on Hacker News**

Mila - MagicBell’s designer - wrote a [great blog post](https://magicbell.com/blog/what-painting-taught-me-about-a-career-in-ui-design) on
her journey from being an artist to a UI designer. The post skyrocketed all the
way to #2 on Hacker News, generating 110+ comments.

### **Edit and delete projects**

After a project is created, it can be edited and / or deleted.

### **Idempotent requests**

Our API API now supports [idempotency](https://magicbell.com/docs/idempotent-requests)
for safely retrying requests without accidentally performing the same operation
twice. This is useful when an API call is disrupted in transit and you do not
receive a response.

### **New Slack community**

We created [a Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/magicbell-community/shared_invite/zt-trh6yi84-~jtPqNikvC1m3My_p0WUqw)
for the MagicBell community. We hope it’s a helpful resource to answer questions,
give product updates, and more!

## June 2021

### **Compose button**

We rolled out a compose button in our dashboard that lets you send notifications
to your users. You can add multiple email addresses or external IDs.

### **Postmark integration**

We've added support for delivering email notifications via Postmark. If you'd
like it setup, please contact us. We'll roll out integrations to our dashboard
in the coming months, but we are happy to set them up for you in the meantime.
We also support Mailgun and SendGrid.

### **Multiple mobile-push apps per project**

We've added support for multiple push apps per project. This is useful if you
use different app bundles for test/canary/production. Please see the [updated documentation](https://magicbell.com/docs/api-reference#operation/create-push-subscription) or
write us if you have any questions.

## May 2021

### **Improved developer documentation site**

Our [new documentation site](https://magicbell.com/docs) went live last week. It's
more readable, features better navigation, and allows us to add live examples
(coming soon!). We'd love to hear your feedback on the structure, and the
content.

### **Goodbye Mobx. Welcome smaller React package!**

This month we also worked to remove MobX from our react packages. You can try
out the beta version of the [@magicbell/magicbell-react package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react/v/8.0.0-beta.8).
The bundle size is 10% smaller, and customers who use MobX can use MagicBell
without any possible conflicts. Furthermore, this release is fully backward
compatible as the API of our components hasn’t changed one bit!

We'll be updating our embeddable, and shipping this improvement to the stable
branch soon.

### **Push subscriptions API**

We have documented the [push subscription API](https://magicbell.com/docs/rest-api/reference#tag/Subscription-to-push-notifications-APIs) that
you can use for both web & mobile push subscriptions. If you'd like to offer
mobile push notifications, please contact us, and we'll help you get started.

## April 2021

### **User deletion API**

We added an [API endpoint](https://developer.magicbell.com/reference#delete_users-user-id) for cases when a user deletes their account and you want to remove them from MagicBell for GDPR compliance.

### **Web push notifications for Safari**

We launched web-push last month but it took us a little longer to get to web-push for Safari. Apple has their own (harder) way of doing everything so it took us a while to get this out the door. We'll write up a blog about this soon.

**New status page and Twitter**

We launched a [better status page](https://status.magicbell.com/) (that lets you subscribe for email updates) as well as a dedicated [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MagicBellStatus) for status updates. We'd still love for you to follow our regular [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/MagicBell_io) too, of-course! :)

**iOS push beta**

iOS push is now in beta and we'd love for you to try it out. Please reply to
this email if you are interested. Android beta coming up next!

## March 2021

### **Notification preferences beta**

The [6.27.0-beta.1 version of the React package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/magicbell-react/v/6.27.0-beta.1) offers a notification preferences UI. We'd love for you to try it and give us some feedback. If you add categories to your [POST /notifications API](https://developer.magicbell.io/reference#notification-send-api) calls, we'll render the preferences matrix for your users - automagically. You can see it in action on our [Chrome extension for Hacker news](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hacker-news-notifications/bbkfblhdgiddlkfkipjdhhfoephonoba?hl=en&authuser=0) (which is pretty awesome, by the way).

![https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/316735864/a0a69ef592ef9ebfb584254a/image.png](https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/316735864/a0a69ef592ef9ebfb584254a/image.png)

This is how the UI looks when we use categories *direct_comment, reply,* and *new_message,* and enable the web push channel for our project.

### **React headless SDK**

A lot of you asked for better React Native support. We just released a [React headless library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@magicbell/react-headless) that contains a set of React headless components and hooks to build a notification inbox in React or React Native. Our official React package has more bells and whistles, but this new library is an excellent option for the more adventurous (or creative) ones! Here is an [example in React Native](https://codesandbox.io/s/ancient-frost-roln4). A full blown React Native library will soon follow.
